# Siren Changer
 Change your FiveM sirens with ease.

> How to use

- For general users, you can delete the `src` folder directory
- Open the .exe
- Select the name that you would like to import into your FiveM
- Click OK, and it will automatically change your siren then launch FiveM

> How to add more sirens

- Open the directory `Sirens`
- Create a new folder
- Copy over your desired `RESIDENT.rpf` file.
NOTE THAT: your RPF file does not need to be archive fixed as this is an automatic function before moving into the GTA directory and launching the game.
